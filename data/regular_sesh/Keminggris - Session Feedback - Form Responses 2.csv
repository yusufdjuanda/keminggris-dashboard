9/21/2025 1:04:36,5,5,5,YES!!!,"the event organizers were super energetic and welcoming.
I thought the small group setup was really clever. It's way easier to actually talk and connect, made it feel more intimate and not a speech to a crowd, per say. An hour flew by so fast because the conversations felt natural and never awkward.

It was refreshing to meet people from so many different walks of life, it felt like a crash course in perspectives as much as in English.

Maybe after the small group talks, leave a few minutes for open mingling, it’d be nice to casually chat with the other groups too, I felt really comfortable in my group with kak Ekky, kak Niko and kak Putri, but also a bit disconnected from everyone else. Totally understand the time crunch though! just a quick suggestion if that resonates with you guys :)","Shoutout to absolutely everyone and especially all of the kakak kakak event organizers. You guys were incredible and I hope you know how much we appreciate all the effort it takes to put something like this together, because of that, we get to just show up and enjoy --so just know it doesn’t go unnoticed, I hope all of u have a lovely night just as much as we did",Ekky,"oh, I already mentioned this in the previous page :) much love!"
