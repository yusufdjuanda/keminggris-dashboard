It's way easier to actually talk and connect, made it feel more intimate and not a speech to a crowd, per say. An hour flew by so fast because the conversations felt natural and never awkward. It was refreshing to meet people from so many different walks of life, it felt like a crash course in perspectives as much as in English. Maybe after the small group talks, leave a few minutes for open mingling, it‚Äôd be nice to casually chat with the other groups too, I felt really comfortable in my group with kak Ekky, kak Niko and kak Putri, but also a bit disconnected from everyone else.
